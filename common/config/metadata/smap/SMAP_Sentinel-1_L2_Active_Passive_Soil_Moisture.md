### Soil Moisture (L2, Active-Passive, Radiometer and Radar)
Temporal coverage: 1 April 2015 to present

This Level-2 (L2) soil moisture product provides estimates of land surface conditions retrieved by both the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer during 6:00 a.m. descending and 6:00 p.m. ascending half-orbit passes and the Sentinel-1A and -1B radar. SMAP L-band brightness temperatures and Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficients are used to derive soil moisture data, which are then resampled to an Earth-fixed, cylindrical 3 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid, Version 2.0 (EASE-Grid 2.0).

Note: These data are Beta-release quality, meaning that they have not undergone full validation and may still contain significant errors.

This data set contains modified Copernicus Sentinel-1 data (2015-present), acquired by the European Space Agency (ESA), distributed through the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), and processed by the SMAP Science Data System.
