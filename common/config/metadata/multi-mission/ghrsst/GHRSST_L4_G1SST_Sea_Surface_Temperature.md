### GHRSST Sea Surface Temperature (L4, G1SST)
Temporal coverage: 21 June 2010 - present

The GHRSST Sea Surface Temperature Level 4, G1SST sea surface temperature analysis product is created using a multi-scale two-dimensional variational (MS-2DVAR) blending algorithm on a global 0.009 degree grid. The Global 1 km SST (G1SST) analysis uses satellite data from sensors that include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager, the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite 1R (MTSAT-1R) radiometer, and in situ data from drifting and moored buoys. The imagery resolution is 1 km, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is from 21 June 2010 to present.
