### GHRSST Sea Surface Temperature (L4, MUR)
Temporal coverage: 1 June 2002 - present

The GHRSST Sea Surface Temperature Level 4, MUR sea surface temperature analysis product uses wavelets as basis functions in an optimal interpolation approach on a global 0.011 degree grid. The version 4 Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments including the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, the US Navy microwave WindSat radiometer and in situ SST observations from the NOAA iQuam project. The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center and are also used for an improved SST parameterization for the high-latitudes. The imagery resolution is 1 km, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is from 1 June 2002 to present.
