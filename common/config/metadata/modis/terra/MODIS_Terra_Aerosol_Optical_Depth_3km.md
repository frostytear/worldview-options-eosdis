### MODIS (Aqua/Terra) Aerosol Optical Depth 3 km (3km, Land and Ocean)
Temporal Coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 3 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The 3 km Aerosol Optical Depth layer was designed to provide a higher-resolution view to meet some users’ needs. Caution should be exercised in urban regions, as there are known issues over urban landscapes. This layer is created from two “Dark Target” (DT) algorithms for retrieving (1) over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths) and (2) over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible).

The MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (3km, Land and Ocean) layer is available from both the Terra (MOD04_3K) and Aqua (MYD04_3K) satellites for day time overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 3 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir, and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.
